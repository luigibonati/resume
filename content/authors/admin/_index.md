I'm a physicist passionate about atomistic simulations and innovative computational methods. In my PhD, I blended machine learning with enhanced sampling techniques, unraveling rare events in physics, chemistry, and biology. Now, I develop and apply these methods to catalytic processes to gain insights into reaction mechanisms and surface dynamics under operating conditions.
